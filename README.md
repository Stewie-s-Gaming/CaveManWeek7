# Unity week 7: Two-dimensional scene-building and path-finding

Improvements from the original code:

1) We decided to implement the path-finding algorithm - A* (A-star).

2) We made "slow-tile", tiles which slow the player advancement and included it in our a* algorithm.

3) We created a map-generator that accepts an array of tiles and generate a map using those tiles. The current optimal map outcomes is using 3 tiles, just like in the game in this browser.

4) You can mine the rocks using the x + arrow buttons, you have to stand next to the rock and use the arrow that points to it!

*  After generating a random map you might get stuck inside a rock, you can just carve your way out!

Have fun!
